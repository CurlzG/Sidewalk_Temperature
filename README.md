# Sidewalk_Temperature
This is my application, creating an android application that would grade the temperature of the sidewalk and indicate how safe it is for the animal to be walking on it

<h4> This application </h4>
<p> This application will make use of the openwaether api, that would give me levels on how to properly read the weather around the person. </p><br>

<h3> The grading system </h3>
<p> The grading itself would have three levels</p> <br>
<p> level 1, which is the safest is anything up to 60 degrees, which is safe for the dogs to walk on </p><br>
<p> level 2, which is when the paws of the animals being walked can be damaged in mintues which will be anything from 60-65 degrees </p><br>
<p> level 3, which is when the paws of the animals will damaged in seconds which is anything greater than 65 degrees </p> <br>
