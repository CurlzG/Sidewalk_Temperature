# Sidewalk_Temperature
This is my application, creating an android application that would grade the temperature of the sidewalk and indicate how safe it is for the animal to be walking on it

<h4> This application </h4>
<p> This application will make use of the openwaether api, that would give me levels on how to properly read the weather around the person. </p><br>
